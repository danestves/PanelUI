 * This is the page somebody lands on to find out whether the thing they want
 * exists, and a list of a hundred and sixteen names and one-line descriptions
 * does not answer that — the names only work if you already know what the
 * library calls things. A silhouette does: you recognise the row of chips, or
 * the sheet coming up from the bottom, before you have read the word.
 *
 * The cards come from `scripts/meta.json`, which is the same file the pages
 * and the sidebar are generated from, so a component added there appears here
 * with no second list to keep in step. A slug with no thumbnail drawn for it
 * yet gets the empty panel rather than breaking the grid.
