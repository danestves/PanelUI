/**
 * The theme picker over the home page's component previews, and the element
 * the previews are themed by.
 *
 * The two halves of it are deliberately different in reach:
 *
 * - **The family** — Panel, Moon, Grass — lands on this wrapper as tokens, so
 *   picking one restyles the previews and leaves the page around them alone.
 *   A visitor comparing three palettes should not have the navigation change
 *   colour under them to do it, and there is no such thing as a Moon docs site
 *   to switch to anyway.
 * - **Light and dark** is the reader's own setting, and there is only one of
 *   it. Two dark switches on a page that disagree is worse than either, so
 *   this one is the site's: it drives the same state the toggle in the
 *   navigation does, and the previews follow it.
 *
 * Only the picker is interactive, so only the picker is a client component —
 * the previews are passed in as `children` and stay server-rendered.
