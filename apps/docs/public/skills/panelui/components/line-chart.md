# LineChart

Animated time series, drawn on the UI thread.

```tsx
import { LineChart } from 'panelui-native';
// Copied into the project with the CLI instead:
// import { LineChart } from '@/components/ui/line-chart';
```

### Usage

```tsx
<LineChart data={visits} xDataKey="month">
  <LineChart.Grid />
  <LineChart.Area dataKey="visits" />
  <LineChart.Line dataKey="visits" />
  <LineChart.XAxis />
  <LineChart.YAxis />
  <LineChart.Tooltip />
</LineChart>
```

### Parts

- `LineChart.Header`
- `LineChart.Grid` — Horizontal reference lines, under everything and outside the reveal.
- `LineChart.Area` — The gradient fill under a series. Separate from the line, because a two-series chart usually wants it on only one of them.
- `LineChart.Line` — One series. Takes its colour from a `--color-chart-*` token unless given one.
- `LineChart.Skeleton` — The flat rule with a sweep along it, shown while `status="loading"`.
- `LineChart.XAxis` — The x labels, as real text under the plot.
- `LineChart.YAxis` — The value labels down the side, one per grid line. Reserves its own gutter.
- `LineChart.Tooltip` — The crosshair and the drag that drives it.
- `LineChart.Legend` — A swatch and a name per registered series.

### Props

#### `LineChartProps`

Extends `ViewProps, ChartAccessibilityProps<LineChartDatum>`.

| Prop | Type | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `className` | `string` | — | — |
| `data` | `LineChartDatum[]` | **required** | The rows. Each one is a point along the x-axis. |
| `xDataKey` | `string` | `date` | Key holding the x label. Used by the axis and the crosshair readout. |
| `status` | `LineChartStatus` | `ready` | `loading` draws a flat skeleton with a sweep running along it, and morphs into the real series when it turns `ready`. One component throughout, rather than a spinner swapped for a chart — swapping loses the transition. |
| `aspectRatio` | `number` | `2` | Width ÷ height. `2` is the wide card shape; `1.6` suits a narrow column. |
| `animationDuration` | `number` | `700` | Milliseconds for the reveal on mount. |
| `domainDuration` | `number` | `500` | Milliseconds for the y-axis to settle after the data changes. |
| `yDomain` | `[number, number]` | — | Fix the y-axis instead of deriving it from the data. |
| `curve` | `LineChartCurve` | `monotone` | `monotone` never overshoots between points; `linear` joins them straight. |
| `onActiveIndexChange` | `(index: number, datum: LineChartDatum \| null) => void` | — | The point under the crosshair as it moves, and `-1`/`null` when the finger lifts. This is how a readout in the card's header gets its value — that header is outside the chart, so it cannot use `useLineChart`. Fires when the index changes, not per frame. |
| `compact` | `boolean` | `false` | Drop the axis padding so the line reaches the edges — for a sparkline with no grid, axis or crosshair, where the shape is the whole point. |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | — |

#### `LineChartGridProps`

| Prop | Type | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `rows` | `number` | — | Horizontal rules across the plot. |
| `color` | `string` | — | — |
| `dashArray` | `string` | — | Dash pattern, e.g. `"4,6"`. Omit for a solid rule. |
| `opacity` | `number` | — | — |

#### `LineChartLineProps`

| Prop | Type | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dataKey` | `string` | **required** | Key holding this series' y values. |
| `color` | `string` | — | Stroke colour. Defaults to the `--color-chart-*` token at `colorIndex`, so a series follows the theme without the call site naming a colour. |
| `colorIndex` | `1 \| 2 \| 3 \| 4 \| 5` | `1` | Which `--color-chart-*` token to take when `color` is not given. |
| `strokeWidth` | `number` | `2.5` | — |
| `dashArray` | `string` | — | Dash pattern, e.g. `"6,4"` — for a projection or a secondary series. |
| `showMarkers` | `boolean` | `false` | A dot at every point. Best kept for short series. |

#### `LineChartAreaProps`

| Prop | Type | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dataKey` | `string` | **required** | — |
| `color` | `string` | — | — |
| `colorIndex` | `1 \| 2 \| 3 \| 4 \| 5` | `1` | — |
| `opacity` | `number` | — | Opacity at the line. Fades to nothing at the baseline. |

#### `LineChartSkeletonProps`

| Prop | Type | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `duration` | `number` | — | Milliseconds for one pass of the sweep. |
| `color` | `string` | — | — |

#### `LineChartXAxisProps`

| Prop | Type | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ticks` | `number` | — | How many labels to show. The rest are dropped, evenly. |
| `format` | `(datum: LineChartDatum, index: number) => string` | — | Turn a row into its label. Defaults to the value at `xDataKey`. |
| `className` | `string` | — | — |

#### `LineChartYAxisProps`

| Prop | Type | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ticks` | `number` | — | How many intervals to divide the axis into. Yields `ticks + 1` labels. |
| `format` | `(value: number) => string` | — | Turn a value into its label. Defaults to a compact number. |
| `className` | `string` | — | — |

#### `LineChartTooltipProps`

| Prop | Type | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `color` | `string` | — | — |
| `showLabel` | `boolean` | — | Float a small label at the crosshair showing the x-value and each series' value at that point — the minimal readout a drag wants. On by default. |
| `formatValue` | `(value: number, key: string) => string` | — | Format one series' value for the label. Defaults to a compact number. |
| `formatX` | `(datum: LineChartDatum) => string` | — | Format the label's heading from the row. Defaults to the value at xDataKey. |

#### `LineChartLegendProps`

Extends `ViewProps`.

| Prop | Type | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `className` | `string` | — | — |
| `labels` | `Record<string, string>` | — | Label per series key. A key with no label falls back to the key itself. |

#### `LineChartHeaderProps`

Extends `ViewProps`.

| Prop | Type | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `className` | `string` | — | — |
| `title` | `string` | — | Small line above the value — what the chart is of. |
| `value` | `string` | — | The readout. The largest thing on the card, and the first thing read. |
| `caption` | `string` | — | One muted line under the value — a period, a comparison, a total. |
| `labels` | `Record<string, string>` | — | Prettier names for the series keys, as the legend takes. |
| `legend` | `boolean` | `false` | Draw a swatch and a name per series along the trailing edge. Prefer this to `LineChart.Legend` on a chart that has a header: the legend floats over the plot, where it competes with the lines for the same corner. |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | Trailing slot — a control, a badge, a range picker. Wins over `legend`. |

### Example — A chart card with a crosshair

Pair it with `Frame`, and add `LineChart.Tooltip`. Dragging across the chart moves a crosshair and floats a small label at the point with the value — the minimal readout a drag wants. The label tracks the finger on the UI thread; only its text crosses back into JS, and only when the active index changes. A stat band above the chart, inside the panel. `Frame.Header` is a caption on the tray the card sits in — one muted line — so a title, a legend, a headline number and a subtitle all crammed into it is four levels of hierarchy in a space with room for one, and the number the card is actually about ends up the hardest part to find.

```tsx
<Frame>
  <Frame.Header>
    <Frame.Title>Monthly Revenue</Frame.Title>
    <Frame.Action>Drag to inspect</Frame.Action>
  </Frame.Header>

  <Frame.Panel>
    <View className="flex-row items-start justify-between px-4 pb-2 pt-3.5">
      <View className="gap-0.5">
        <Text size="2xl" weight="bold">$317,904</Text>
        <Text size="sm" muted>Last 12 months</Text>
      </View>
    </View>

    <LineChart data={revenue} xDataKey="month">
      <LineChart.Grid />
      <LineChart.Area dataKey="revenue" />
      <LineChart.Line dataKey="revenue" />
      <LineChart.XAxis ticks={5} />
      <LineChart.Tooltip formatValue={(v) => `$${v.toLocaleString()}`} />
    </LineChart>
  </Frame.Panel>
</Frame>
```

### Notes

### The two layers

The geometry is SVG and anything with text or a gesture on it is a React Native view laid over the top. The parts sort themselves into the right layer, so composition stays a flat list of children — but it is why `LineChart.XAxis` renders real text rather than SVG text. SVG text ignores the platform's text scaling and the theme's font, and a gesture handler cannot be attached to an SVG node at all.

### Three animations, three reasons

**The reveal** uncovers the plot left to right on mount, with everything inside sharing one clip — so the line, its fill and its markers arrive together rather than as three separate effects.

**The y-domain** is tweened when the data changes, rather than the path being swapped. A series that grows is redrawn against a moving axis instead of jumping to a new shape. The reveal deliberately does not replay: it happened once, and repeating it on every refresh turns a data update into an animation.

**The crosshair** resolves the nearest index on the UI thread. Only that index crosses back into JS, and only when it changes, so a drag across a hundred points costs a hundred re-renders at most rather than one per frame.

All three respect the system's reduce-motion setting: the chart renders at its final state instead.

### Reading out the active point

`onActiveIndexChange` fires as the crosshair moves between points, and with `-1`/`null` when the finger lifts. That is the one to use for a readout in the card header, because the header is outside the chart and a hook cannot reach up out of the subtree it is called in. `useLineChart` is for something rendered *inside* the chart, which is the rarer case.

### The crosshair label

`LineChart.Tooltip` floats a small label at the crosshair by default, showing the x-value and each series' value at that point. Turn it off with `showLabel={false}`, or format its numbers with `formatValue`. For a readout in the card *header* instead — outside the plot, where it does not cover the line — use `onActiveIndexChange` on the root.

### The curve

`monotone` is the default and is the right one for a time series. A plain cubic spline overshoots between points, so a series that never goes below zero draws a dip under the axis between two low values — a shape that is not in the data. Use `curve="linear"` when the points are exact readings and the eye should not be given anything between them.

### Sizing

The chart fills its parent's width and takes its height from `aspectRatio`. Give it a wider ratio for a card and a squarer one for a narrow column; do not set a height directly, as the aspect ratio is what keeps the plot geometry stable while the layout settles.

### Laying out a chart card

`Frame.Header` is a caption on the tray the card sits in — one muted line, a title on the left and a short note or control on the right. The headline reading, the legend and any subtitle belong in the panel, in a band above the chart.

Putting all of them in the header is the usual way a chart card goes wrong: four levels of hierarchy in a strip with room for one, and the number the card is actually about ends up the hardest thing on it to find. A legend of four keys makes it worse, because it wraps onto a second row on a narrow phone and pushes the chart down the card.

**`aspectRatio` measures the plot, not the whole chart.** The header sits above the drawing area rather than inside it, so a chart with a readout is taller than its ratio alone suggests — measure the box and the header would eat into the plot while still claiming the shape you asked for.

**Labels sit on what they name.** Each x label is placed on its own point, and each y label is centred on the grid line it belongs to. `Grid`'s `rows` and `YAxis`'s `ticks` have to match for the numbers to line up; both default to `4`.

## Accessible data

The chart exposes one screen-reader summary and one semantic entry per data row; its SVG paths, axes and markers stay decorative. Set `accessibilityLabel` for a domain-specific summary, `accessibilityLabelForDatum` to format each row, and `onAccessibilityDatumPress` when selecting a row should perform an action. Pass `accessible={false}` only when the same data is already available nearby in an accessible table.
