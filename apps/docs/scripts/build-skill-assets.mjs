/**
 * Publishes the agent skill: copies `skills/` into `public/skills/` and writes
 * the discovery index's data to `lib/skills.generated.json`.
 *
 * The skill has existed in this repository since it was written, and until now
 * the only way to get it was to clone the repository — which an agent that has
 * just discovered the domain cannot do. Copying it under `public/` puts it on
 * the site at a URL, and the index at `/.well-known/agent-skills/index.json`
 * is what points at that URL.
 *
 * The digest is the reason this is generated rather than hand-written. The
 * discovery format asks for a SHA-256 of each artifact so a client can tell
 * whether the copy it cached is still the copy being served, and a hash written
 * by hand is wrong the first time anybody edits the file it describes.
 * `components.md` in particular is itself generated, from `meta.json`, on every
 * `docs:generate` — so its hash changes whenever a component is added.
 *
 * Runs in the `docs:generate` chain and in `prebuild`, so the deployed site
 * cannot serve an index whose digests disagree with its files.
