/**
 * What a tab set must not do when there are more tabs than fit.
 *
 * Reported as a flicker on every switch in a long row: the tabs jump back
 * towards the first one and then return to the selected one. Four things in
 * this file could produce that, all of them only reachable once the row is long
 * enough to scroll or the panels are long enough to page, and each one is
 * checked here because none of them is visible in a tab set of three.
