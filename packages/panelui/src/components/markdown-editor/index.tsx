/**
 * MarkdownEditor — a field for writing markdown, and a way to see it rendered.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const [draft, setDraft] = useState('');
 *
 * <MarkdownEditor value={draft} onValueChange={setDraft} rows={12} />
 * ```
 *
 * ## Writing and reading are two modes, not two panes
 *
 * Side by side is how this is done on a desktop, and it does not survive the
 * trip to a phone: two columns of a phone's width are two columns too narrow to
 * read, and the keyboard covers the bottom half of the screen exactly when the
 * writer is using it. So there is one pane and a switch — write, or read what
 * you wrote. The toolbar carries the switch, because the toolbar is the one
 * thing on screen in both modes.
 *
 * ## The toolbar edits the selection
 *
 * Every button here is a function of the text and where the caret is in it, and
 * the answer that matters is not which characters get inserted but where the
 * caret lands afterwards. Bolding a selected phrase leaves it selected, so it
 * can be italicised next; bolding nothing puts the caret between the new
 * markers, where the writing is about to go; and pressing the same button again
 * takes the markers off. Those rules live in `markdown-transforms.ts` as pure
 * functions over `(text, selection)`, away from anything to do with a field.
 *
 * ## Why it renders through Response
 *
 * The preview is `Response`, the same reader that renders a model's answer, so
 * markdown means the same thing everywhere in the library and there is one
 * parser to be right rather than two to keep in step. It renders through
 * `Typography`, `CodeBlock` and `Table`, which is to say through the app's own
 * type and colours — a preview that looked like a document viewer would be
 * showing the writer something they are not going to ship.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches for a platform markdown renderer. `Text` in SwiftUI can
 * parse markdown and Jetpack Compose's cannot, so a platform-backed editor
 * would render on one of the two and be a plain string on the other.
 *
 * Works controlled (`value` + `onValueChange`) or uncontrolled (`defaultValue`).
