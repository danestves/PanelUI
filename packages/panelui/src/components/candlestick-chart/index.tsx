/**
 * CandlestickChart — four numbers a period, drawn as one mark.
 *
 * Composed the same way every chart here is: the grid, the candles, the axes
 * and the readout are separate children, so a chart that wants no grid simply
 * does not have one.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <CandlestickChart data={session} xDataKey="day">
 *   <CandlestickChart.Grid />
 *   <CandlestickChart.Candles />
 *   <CandlestickChart.XAxis />
 *   <CandlestickChart.Tooltip />
 * </CandlestickChart>
 * ```
 *
 * ## One mark, four numbers
 *
 * A row is `{ open, high, low, close }`. The body spans open to close and is
 * filled by direction — rising when the close is at or above the open, falling
 * when it is below — and the wick spans low to high behind it. Colour is
 * therefore the *sign* of the period rather than a series identity, which is
 * why this chart has no series list and no legend: there is only ever one
 * thing plotted, and the two colours are its two states.
 *
 * ## The baseline is not zero, and must not be
 *
 * A bar compares lengths, so its axis has to reach zero or twice as tall stops
 * meaning twice as much. A candle compares nothing to zero. What is being read
 * is the distance between four numbers that sit close together and far from the
 * origin — a share at 180 that moved between 178 and 183 is a chart of that
 * five-point span, and forcing zero onto the axis turns every candle in it into
 * a dash. So the domain is derived from the lowest low and the highest high,
 * with a margin so the extremes are not drawn on the frame.
 *
 * ## Two paths, not two per candle
 *
 * Every rising body is a subpath of one path and every falling body of another,
 * and the wicks likewise — four animated props a frame whether the chart holds
 * twenty candles or two hundred. A candle also cannot be drawn as a rectangle
 * element and animated: the grow-in scales each body about its own middle, and
 * that is a path rebuilt per frame on the UI thread rather than a transform
 * that would take the wick and the neighbours with it.

 * introducing itself.
