/**
 * SectionProgress — a floating pill saying how far through a screen you are,
 * and which part of it you are in.
 *
 * A ring filled to the scroll position, and beside it the title of the section
 * being read. Pressed, it opens into the list of sections and jumps to any of
 * them.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const sections = useScrollSections({ ids: SECTIONS.map((s) => s.id) });
 *
 * <SectionProgress
 *   scroll={sections.scroll}
 *   value={sections.active}
 *   onValueChange={sections.scrollTo}
 * >
 *   <SectionProgress.Item value="intro">Introduction</SectionProgress.Item>
 *   <SectionProgress.Item value="setup">Setup</SectionProgress.Item>
 * </SectionProgress>
 * ```
 *
 * ## Two readings, one control
 *
 * The ring is continuous and the label is not, and that is the point: a
 * percentage says how much is left, a section name says what is being read.
 * Either on its own leaves the other question open — a bar at 60% of an
 * unfamiliar page means nothing in particular, and a heading with no sense of
 * depth is a position without a scale.
 *
 * ## It arrives, and then it stays
 *
 * Nothing is drawn on the first screen. Past `revealAt` the pill fades in and
 * remains for the rest of the scroll — it does not hide again on the way back
 * up. A label that comes and goes with the scroll direction is one the reader
 * has to catch rather than read.
 *
 * ## One surface, not a card above a button
 *
 * Open, the list and the pill are a single bordered box: the pill's row is the
 * end of the card rather than a control sitting under a panel of its own. Two
 * boxes would draw two outlines a few points apart, and the pill would read as
 * something the list had landed on top of rather than as the thing it grew
 * out of.
 *
 * The card is the only thing carrying a border, a background and a shadow.
 * Everything inside it is a row.
 *
 * ## The section, and the colour it brings
 *
 * An `Item` may carry a `color`, and the active one's colour is taken by the
 * ring, the label and a wash across the pill, crossfading as the reader moves
 * between sections. It turns the pill into a second, peripheral signal — the
 * part of the page you are in, readable without the words.

 * animation keeps the view mounted as a snapshot while the card re-lays-out
 * around it — the card shrinks to the pill under a list that is still on
 * screen, so the control shifts and settles back over the following frames.
