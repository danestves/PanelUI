/**
 * SearchBar — a text field for querying a list, with the two controls a search
 * needs and an ordinary field does not, and a panel of results that opens out
 * of the field itself.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <SearchBar placeholder="Search orders" onSubmit={run} />
 * <SearchBar variant="filled" shape="pill" cancel="focus" />
 * <SearchBar avoidKeyboard value={query} onChangeText={setQuery}>
 *   <SearchBar.Section label="Suggested">
 *     <SearchBar.Item trailing={<AddButton />} onPress={add}>Claude</SearchBar.Item>
 *   </SearchBar.Section>
 * </SearchBar>
 * ```
 *
 * ## The results are above the field, and the field is above the keyboard
 *
 * A search that is being typed into has a keyboard under it, and a list drawn
 * below the field is a list drawn behind the keyboard. So `avoidKeyboard`
 * lifts the field until it sits `keyboardOffset` points clear of the keyboard's
 * top edge, and the panel opens *upward* out of it into the space that is
 * actually free.
 *
 * That puts the first result nearest the field and the last one furthest away,
 * which is the order a reader walking away from the caret expects. Pass
 * `panelPlacement="bottom"` for a search bar in a header, where the space is
 * the other way round.
 *
 * The panel is positioned absolutely rather than laid out in the flow, so
 * opening it never moves the page underneath — a list that pushes the field it
 * belongs to is a field that walks away from the finger typing into it.
 *
 * ## Touches inside the panel must not close the keyboard
 *
 * The panel scrolls with `keyboardShouldPersistTaps="always"`, and every press
 * inside it holds the field's focus open for a moment afterwards. Both are
 * needed, because a search closes the instant the field blurs and there are
 * two separate ways for a touch in the panel to blur it.
 *
 * `"handled"` only spares presses a child takes responsibility for, which
 * leaves the panel's own padding, the gaps between rows, a section heading and
 * the whole of `SearchBar.Status` as live dismiss surfaces — tapping the word
 * "Searching …" would end the search. `"always"` gives the panel back.
 *
 * The focus guard covers the other way: a control inside a row — an add
 * button, a remove ✕ — takes focus with the press on Android, and returning it
 * a frame later is not enough on its own, because the blur has already closed
 * the panel the control was drawn in. So a press in the panel marks the field
 * as still being used, and a blur arriving under that mark is answered by
 * asking for focus back rather than by ending the search.
 *
 * ## What has already been picked goes in the field
 *
 * `tokens` puts the choices made so far inside the field, before the caret, so
 * the query and what it has produced are one control rather than a control and
 * a list somewhere above it. `SearchBar.Token` is the chip; backspace on an
 * empty field fires `onRemoveLastToken`, which is what a token field does
 * everywhere else.
 *
 * They scroll rather than wrap: the field is one line tall, and a row of chips
 * that grew it would move the caret every time something was picked.
 *
 * ## The clear button, and why it is not the platform's
 *
 * A ✕ appears inside the field as soon as there is something to clear, and
 * takes it back to empty without dismissing the keyboard — clearing a query is
 * the start of the next one, not the end of the search. It is drawn here
 * rather than left to `clearButtonMode`, which exists on iOS only, cannot be
 * labelled for a screen reader and cannot be swapped for a spinner while
 * results are in flight.
 *
 * The glyph is 24 points and its touch box is 48, made up with slop rather
 * than with size. A 48-point circle inside a 40-point field either overflows
 * it or forces every search bar in an app to be as tall as the largest one.
 *
 * ## Cancel is a row, not a decoration
 *
 * `cancel="focus"` puts a Cancel button beside the field and slides it in
 * while the field is being edited, which is the platform's own answer to
 * "how do I get out of this search". It is a sibling of the field rather than
 * something inside it, because it acts on the search as a whole: it empties
 * the query, drops focus and calls `onCancel`, and a control that ends the
 * thing it sits inside reads as part of the query it is about to discard.
 *
 * Its width is measured once and animated on the UI thread. The button is
 * always mounted when `cancel` is not `never`, so the measurement is already
 * there the first time the field is touched and the first slide is as smooth
 * as the tenth.
 *
 * ## Debouncing belongs to the caller's search, not to the field
 *
 * `onChangeText` always fires on every keystroke — a controlled field that
 * lags its own input is unusable. `debounce` is about the *query*: it holds
 * `onDebouncedChange` until typing pauses, so a network search runs once per
 * pause instead of once per letter. Submitting flushes it immediately, since
 * a return key is somebody saying they are done waiting.
