/**
 * Tooltip — a small label that names the thing under your finger.
 *
 * A popover is a panel you open and deal with; a tooltip is a whisper. It
 * carries a word or two about what a control does, appears without taking the
 * screen, and goes away on its own. That is why it is inverted by default, why
 * it is not dismissible with a scrim, and why it closes after a beat instead of
 * waiting to be told.
 *
 * The inversion is a default rather than a rule, because the whisper has a
 * larger sibling: a tooltip that carries a heading and a sentence stops reading
 * as a different layer and starts reading as a panel with the wrong colours.
 * `variant="surface"` makes it one, and the sizing props — `width`,
 * `minWidth`, `maxHeight`, `scrollable` — are what let it hold that much.
 *
 * On touch there is no hover to open it, so the gesture is a long press by
 * default — the platform's own "tell me more" gesture — with `openOn="press"`
 * for the cases where a tap should reveal it instead.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <Tooltip label="Copy link">
 *   <Tooltip.Trigger>
 *     <IconButton icon={<LinkIcon />} />
 *   </Tooltip.Trigger>
 *   <Tooltip.Content>
 *     <Tooltip.Arrow />
 *     Copy link
 *   </Tooltip.Content>
 * </Tooltip>
 * ```
 *
 * Placement is a preference, not a promise: the trigger is measured when it is
 * pressed, the label measures itself on its first layout, and the two are
 * reconciled against the safe area — so `placement="top"` means *above, if
 * above fits*, and a trigger near the top edge shows its tooltip below instead.
