/**
 * ContextMenu — the actions that belong to a piece of content, opened on it.
 *
 * A `Menu` hangs off a control that exists to be pressed: a ⋯ button, a toolbar
 * item, something whose whole job is to open the menu. A context menu has no
 * such control. The target is the content itself — a message, a note, a photo,
 * a row — and the actions are reached by holding it, by a named accessibility
 * action, or from the keyboard.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <ContextMenu>
 *   <ContextMenu.Trigger>
 *     <Message>Would you like an interactive todo list?</Message>
 *   </ContextMenu.Trigger>
 *   <ContextMenu.Content>
 *     <ContextMenu.Item icon={<Share2 size={16} />}>Share</ContextMenu.Item>
 *     <ContextMenu.Item icon={<Copy size={16} />}>Copy</ContextMenu.Item>
 *     <ContextMenu.Separator />
 *     <ContextMenu.Item variant="destructive" icon={<Flag size={16} />}>
 *       Report
 *     </ContextMenu.Item>
 *   </ContextMenu.Content>
 * </ContextMenu>
 * ```
 *
 * ## It is a Menu, and deliberately so
 *
 * The rows here *are* `Menu`'s rows — the same components, not a second set
 * styled to match. `ContextMenu.Item` and `Menu.Item` are one implementation,
 * so the destructive colour, the press-in scale, the indicator column and the
 * dismiss-on-select rule cannot drift apart between the two ways of reaching
 * them. The panel is `Menu`'s panel, which is `Popover`'s, so `presentation`,
 * submenus and edge-flipping all arrive already working.
 *
 * What this component owns is what a menu opened on content needs and a menu
 * opened from a button does not: alternate invocation paths, and where the
 * panel goes.
 *
 * ## Anchored to the finger, not to the target
 *
 * A toolbar menu is placed against its trigger, because the trigger is small
 * and its position is the only sensible answer. A context menu's target is
 * often most of the screen — a whole message, a whole card — and the middle of
 * it is not where the finger was. So the anchor is the press point by default,
 * and the panel unfolds from it the way a popover unfolds from a button.
 *
 * `anchor="target"` places it against the target's bounds instead, which is the
 * better answer for something small and list-shaped, where the panel lining up
 * with the row reads as belonging to it.
 *
 * ## Why the gesture is not a Pressable
 *
 * The target usually has a press of its own — open the thread, play the video,
 * follow the link — and the two must not both fire. React Native's `Pressable`
 * decides between them after the fact, and the tap can still get through on the
 * way to a long press; the recogniser here is asked for the arbitration up
 * front instead, so a hold that opens the menu never also counts as a press.
 *
 * It is also what lets the target be anything at all. A cloned `onLongPress`
 * needs a child that takes one, which rules out exactly the plain views —
 * bubbles, cards, images — that content-native actions are usually attached to.

/**
 * The panel, with the defaults a context menu wants rather than a popover's.
 *
 * It unfolds down and from the press rather than being centred on it —
 * centring is right for a panel under a button, and wrong for one at a
 * fingertip, where it would put half the panel back under the hand that opened
 * it. Near the bottom of the screen `Popover` flips it above the press and
 * clamps it into the safe area, so the one case where down does not work
 * answers itself.
 *
 * The gap to the anchor is small, so the panel reads as coming out of the press
 * rather than floating near it.
 *
 * The screen dims behind it, which a popover does not do. A context menu is
 * modal in practice — the content underneath is what the actions are *about*,
 * so nothing else on the screen is available while it is up, and the dim is
 * what says so.
