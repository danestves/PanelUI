/**
 * ColorPicker — a colour chosen by dragging, not by typing.
 *
 * The controls are the colour model made visible: a square where saturation
 * runs across and brightness runs up, under a hue picked on its own scale.
 * That is why the component stores hue, saturation, value and alpha rather
 * than the string it hands back — a fully black colour is `#000` whatever hue
 * and saturation produced it, so a picker that stored the output would lose
 * the thumb the moment you dragged into a corner and could not put it back.
 *
 * Nothing about a drag crosses to JavaScript. The four channels are shared
 * values; the hue behind the square, both thumb fills and the preview swatch
 * are `backgroundColor`s computed from them on the UI thread, and the
 * translucency ramp on the alpha track is a gradient used as a mask over a
 * solid fill rather than a gradient whose colours have to be re-declared from
 * React on every frame. The picked colour bridges back on change and again on
 * release, the same as any other input here.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <ColorPicker defaultValue="#22c55e" onValueCommit={setBrand}>
 *   <ColorPicker.Area />
 *   <ColorPicker.Hue />
 *   <ColorPicker.Preview showValue />
 * </ColorPicker>
 * ```
 *
 * Composition is the API: a picker is whichever of the parts you put in it, so
 * a control with no alpha is one that has no `ColorPicker.Alpha`, not one with
 * a prop turned off.
 *
 * ## Folding it away
 *
 * A picker is a page's worth of controls in service of one value, and that
 * value is read far more often than it is changed — so `presentation` puts the
 * controls behind the row that reads it out:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <ColorPicker value={accent} onValueChange={setAccent} presentation="popover">
 *   <ColorPicker.Trigger>
 *     <ColorPicker.Field label="Accent" />
 *   </ColorPicker.Trigger>
 *   <ColorPicker.Content>
 *     <ColorPicker.Area />
 *     <ColorPicker.Hue />
 *   </ColorPicker.Content>
 * </ColorPicker>
 * ```
 *
 * `Content` re-provides the picker's context around what it holds, because the
 * panel is portalled above the rest of the screen and is therefore no longer
 * below the picker in the tree by the time the parts inside it go looking.
 *
 * Works controlled (`value` + `onValueChange`) or uncontrolled (`defaultValue`).
