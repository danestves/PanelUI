/**
 * Combobox — a text field that filters a list of options as you type.
 *
 * The difference from Select is where the typing happens, and it is not a
 * detail: a Select is a button that opens a list, and its optional filter lives
 * *inside* the list once it is open. A Combobox is the field itself. You are
 * already typing when the options appear, which is what you want when the value
 * is something you know the name of — a city, a repository, a tag — rather than
 * something you expect to recognise by scrolling.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <Combobox value={framework} onValueChange={setFramework}>
 *   <Combobox.Item value="expo" label="Expo" />
 *   <Combobox.Item value="next" label="Next.js" />
 * </Combobox>
 * ```
 *
 * ## Two presentations, and why there is no sheet
 *
 * `overlay` (default) floats the list above the page through a portal, anchored
 * under the field and flipped above it when the keyboard leaves no room below.
 * `inline` expands the list in normal layout flow instead, which is right in a
 * form where nothing should be covered.
 *
 * There is deliberately no sheet presentation. A sheet takes the bottom of the
 * screen, which is exactly where the keyboard is, and the field you are typing
 * into would end up behind one or the other. Select can offer a sheet because
 * its trigger stops mattering once the list is open; a Combobox's never does.
 *
 * ## Filtering is yours to turn off
 *
 * Filtering happens here by default, matching case-insensitively on any part of
 * an option's label. That is the whole feature for a list you already have in
 * hand. When the options come from a server that is doing the matching itself,
 * pass `filter={false}` and render whatever came back — the field stops second-
 * guessing results it cannot see the query behind.
 *
 * ## Values it does not know about
 *
 * `allowCustomValue` lets the typed text become the value when it matches no
 * option, which is how a tag field works: the list is a set of suggestions
 * rather than the set of legal answers.
