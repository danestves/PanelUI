/**
 * FlipCard — two faces of one card, and a turn between them.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <FlipCard>
 *   <FlipCard.Front className="items-center justify-center rounded-2xl bg-card p-6">
 *     <Text>Tap me</Text>
 *   </FlipCard.Front>
 *   <FlipCard.Back className="items-center justify-center rounded-2xl bg-primary p-6">
 *     <Text className="text-primary-foreground">The other side</Text>
 *   </FlipCard.Back>
 * </FlipCard>
 * ```
 *
 * For content that is genuinely two-sided — a bank card and its security code,
 * a term and its definition, a photograph and what it is of. Not for
 * progressive disclosure: the back replaces the front rather than extending
 * it, so anything the reader needs to compare across the turn belongs in
 * [Collapsible](../collapsible) or a second card instead.
 *
 * ## The front sizes the card
 *
 * The back is laid over the front, so the card is the front's size and the
 * back is given that box to fill. A back with more in it than the front will
 * overflow rather than grow the card, and the fix is a height on the root
 * rather than more padding on the back — a card whose height changed halfway
 * through the turn would be a card that moved everything under it.
 *
 * ## Both faces are hidden the same way twice
 *
 * `backfaceVisibility` is the mechanism, and it is not reliable on every
 * Android surface — so the face that has turned away is also faded out and
 * dropped behind, on the same shared value, at the halfway point. Two
 * mechanisms for one job, because the failure of the first is a card that
 * shows both faces mirrored through each other and nothing in the tree that
 * says why.
 *
 * ## Under reduce motion
 *
 * The faces swap with no turn at all. Not a shorter turn — none. The rotation
 * is the part that moves, and moving is the part the setting is about; which
 * face is showing is the information, and it is kept.
