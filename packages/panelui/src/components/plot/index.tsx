/**
 * Plot — a chart you assemble, for the chart that is not in the box.
 *
 * The other charts in this library each answer one question and answer it
 * completely: a line chart knows it is drawing a series over time, and every
 * decision inside it follows from that. This one knows nothing. It measures a
 * box, resolves a scale, and hands both to whatever marks you put in it — so a
 * combination nothing here ships as its own component is still a chart you can
 * build rather than a chart you have to go without.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <Plot data={months} xDataKey="month">
 *   <Plot.Grid />
 *   <Plot.Bars dataKey="orders" colorIndex={2} />
 *   <Plot.Line dataKey="revenue" />
 *   <Plot.YAxis />
 *   <Plot.XAxis />
 *   <Plot.Cursor />
 *   <Plot.Tooltip />
 * </Plot>
 * ```
 *
 * ## One scale, however many marks
 *
 * Every mark reads the same plot box and the same y-domain, and the domain is
 * derived from all of them together. That is the whole reason to compose rather
 * than to stack two charts on top of each other: two scales drawn over each
 * other look like a comparison and are not one.
 *
 * ## Where your own marks go
 *
 * `Plot.Layer` drops its children into the SVG tree, and `usePlot()` gives them
 * the resolved geometry — the box, the tweening domain, the reveal, the palette.
 * The scale functions are worklets exported alongside this component, so a mark
 * of your own is rebuilt on the UI thread on the same frames these are:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * function Threshold({ value }: { value: number }) {
 *   const { plot, domainMin, domainMax } = usePlot();
 *   const props = useAnimatedProps(() => {
 *     const y = yOf(value, plot, domainMin.value, domainMax.value);
 *     return { d: `M${plot.left},${y}H${plot.left + plot.width}` };
 *   });
 *   return <AnimatedPath animatedProps={props} stroke="red" />;
 * }
 *
 * <Plot data={rows}>
 *   <Plot.Layer><Threshold value={80} /></Plot.Layer>
 * </Plot>
 * ```
 *
 * Anything that is text or takes a touch goes in `Plot.Overlay` instead, which
 * is a React Native view over the drawing. That split is not a preference: SVG
 * text ignores the platform's text scaling and the theme's font, and a gesture
 * handler cannot be attached to an SVG node at all.
 *
 * ## What it will not do for you
 *
 * There is no `type` prop and no set of defaults that guess at one. A chart
 * assembled here is exactly the marks you wrote, in the order you wrote them —
 * which is also the order they are drawn in, so a line over bars is a line
 * written after them.
