/**
 * Sortable — a list whose rows can be dragged into a different order.
 *
 * The one list interaction nothing else in the library covers. `Swipe` acts on
 * a row, `Tree` opens one, `Table` sorts every row at once by a column — none
 * of them let a person say *this one goes above that one*, which is how a
 * playlist, a task list, a set of form fields or a run of dashboard tiles is
 * actually arranged.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const [tasks, setTasks] = useState(TASKS);
 *
 * <Sortable
 *   value={tasks.map((task) => task.id)}
 *   onReorder={(_, { from, to }) => setTasks((t) => reorderItems(t, from, to))}
 *   gap={8}
 * >
 *   {tasks.map((task) => (
 *     <Sortable.Item key={task.id} id={task.id}>
 *       <Item variant="outline">
 *         <Item.Content>
 *           <Item.Title>{task.title}</Item.Title>
 *         </Item.Content>
 *         <Sortable.Handle />
 *       </Item>
 *     </Sortable.Item>
 *   ))}
 * </Sortable>
 * ```
 *
 * ## Nothing is ever moved in the tree
 *
 * The rows stay exactly where they were laid out and are pushed around with
 * transforms. A row's offset is the difference between where its slot sits in
 * the order being dragged and where it sits in the order that was rendered —
 * one subtraction, on the UI thread, per row per frame. Reordering the
 * children instead would mean React reconciling the whole list on every slot
 * the finger crosses, which is the one thing a drag cannot afford.
 *
 * It also means the component never owns the order. It reports where a row was
 * dropped and the list is the caller's to rearrange, because the caller is the
 * only one who knows what the ids stand for — a `value` that disagreed with
 * the children would put rows in places their content had not moved to.
 *
 * ## Heights are measured, not assumed
 *
 * Every row reports its own height, so a list of rows of different sizes lands
 * in the right slots. A fixed row height would be one number to get wrong in
 * every list that has a two-line row in it, and the measurement costs one
 * layout pass on mount.
 *
 * ## Where the drop is reported
 *
 * `onReorder` fires when the row has finished settling, not when the finger
 * lifts. Between those two moments the row is animating into a slot that the
 * layout does not know about yet; re-rendering the list in the middle of that
 * would relayout every row underneath it and the settling row would jump. By
 * the time the callback runs the rows are already where the new order puts
 * them, so the re-render that follows changes nothing on screen.
