/**
 * Edge geometry for Flow.
 *
 * Every function here is a worklet, because all of it runs against node
 * positions held in a shared value: an edge recomputes its `d` string on the UI
 * thread as a node is dragged, and a worklet may only call another worklet.
 * They take and return plain numbers for the same reason — crossing the bridge
 * per frame is exactly what this design exists to avoid.
 *
 * Kept out of `index.tsx` so the component file stays about components. Named
 * `flow-paths` rather than `paths` because the registry copies a component's
 * whole directory into one flat `ui/` folder, where `paths.ts` would be a land
 * grab on a very common name.
