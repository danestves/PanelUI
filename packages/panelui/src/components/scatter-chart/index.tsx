/**
 * ScatterChart — two quantities against each other, drawn on the UI thread.
 *
 * Every other chart in this library spaces its points evenly along the x-axis,
 * because their x is a position: twelve months are twelve equal steps whatever
 * the gaps between the dates behind them. A scatter plot is the one shape where
 * that is wrong. Both coordinates are *measured*, and the reader is being asked
 * to look for a relationship between them — spread the points evenly and the
 * relationship is the one thing you have thrown away.
 *
 * So this chart carries an x-domain as well as a y-domain, and both are tweened
 * when the data changes.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <ScatterChart data={sessions} xDataKey="spend">
 *   <ScatterChart.Grid />
 *   <ScatterChart.Points dataKey="revenue" />
 *   <ScatterChart.XAxis />
 *   <ScatterChart.YAxis />
 *   <ScatterChart.Tooltip />
 * </ScatterChart>
 * ```
 *
 * As elsewhere, there are two layers and the parts sort themselves into the
 * right one: the geometry is SVG, and anything with text or a gesture on it is
 * a React Native view over the top. SVG text ignores the platform's text
 * scaling and the theme's font, and a gesture handler cannot be attached to an
 * SVG node at all.
 *
 * **Finding a point.** A crosshair that snaps to an x index — the way a line
 * chart's does — has nothing to snap to here, because there is no shared x and
 * two points can sit at the same one. Instead the nearest point to the finger
 * is resolved by distance, on the UI thread, and only within a radius: a touch
 * in an empty corner of the plot selects nothing rather than lighting up
 * whichever point happens to be least far away. The radius is generous, because
 * the points are a few pixels across and a fingertip is not.
 *
 * Colours come from the `--color-chart-*` tokens, so a chart follows the active
 * theme. Nothing here hardcodes a hex.
