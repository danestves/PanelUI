/**
 * Splitter — panes that share a container, with a seam between them the reader
 * can drag.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <Splitter className="h-64" defaultLayout={[65, 35]}>
 *   <Splitter.Panel minSize={30}>{list}</Splitter.Panel>
 *   <Splitter.Handle />
 *   <Splitter.Panel minSize={20} collapsible>{detail}</Splitter.Panel>
 * </Splitter>
 * ```
 *
 * Sizes are percentages of the splitter, so a layout dragged in portrait is
 * still the same layout in landscape. The splitter itself has no height of its
 * own — give it one, or put it in something that does, or it collapses to
 * nothing and takes its panes with it.
 *
 * The seams are drawn over the panes rather than between them. A handle that
 * took layout space would have to be measured before the panes could be sized,
 * which puts the whole layout downstream of a number nobody controls; floating
 * it means the panes add up to exactly the container and the handle can be as
 * wide a target as a finger needs without changing anything.
 *
 * Dragging runs on the UI thread. `onLayoutChange` fires when the seam is let
 * go rather than on every frame, because a layout that round-trips through
 * React sixty times a second is the one thing that makes this feel slow.
