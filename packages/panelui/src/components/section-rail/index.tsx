/**
 * SectionRail — a floating navigator for a long screen.
 *
 * A stack of short bars pinned to one edge, one per section, that expands into
 * a labelled panel when you touch it. Collapsed it is a position indicator you
 * can read at a glance without giving up any content width; expanded it is a
 * list you can jump from.
 *
 * The bars are deliberately unlabelled. A permanent list of section titles
 * down the side of a phone screen is either too small to read or too wide to
 * keep — the bars carry only the two things that survive at that size, which
 * section you are in and roughly how deep it sits.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <SectionRail value={active} onValueChange={scrollTo}>
 *   <SectionRail.Trigger>
 *     <SectionRail.Bar value="intro" />
 *     <SectionRail.Bar value="setup" level={1} />
 *   </SectionRail.Trigger>
 *   <SectionRail.Content>
 *     <SectionRail.Item value="intro">Introduction</SectionRail.Item>
 *     <SectionRail.Item value="setup" level={1}>Setup</SectionRail.Item>
 *   </SectionRail.Content>
 * </SectionRail>
 * ```
 *
 * It floats: the root is absolutely positioned and lets touches through
 * everywhere it is not drawing, so the content underneath still scrolls.
