/**
 * Textarea — a field for text that runs to several lines.
 *
 * It shares Input's focus treatment: the border crosses between two colours on
 * the UI thread over 150ms rather than snapping, because a border that switches
 * wholesale reads as a redraw instead of as the field answering you.
 *
 * Height comes from `rows` rather than from a class, so it composes with `size`
 * instead of fighting it — three rows of 14px text and three rows of 16px text
 * are different heights, and both are three rows. `autoGrow` then lets the
 * field follow its content up to `maxRows`, after which it scrolls, which is
 * the behaviour a composer wants: it starts small, opens up as you write, and
 * stops before it eats the screen.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <Textarea label="Notes" placeholder="Anything we should know?" />
 * <Textarea autoGrow rows={2} maxRows={8} showCount maxLength={280} />
 * ```
 *
 * For a single line, reach for `Input`.
