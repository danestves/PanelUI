/**
 * WaterfallChart — how a run of changes carried one total to another.
 *
 * Composed the same way the other charts are: the grid, the bars, the
 * connectors, the axes and the readout are separate children, so a chart that
 * wants no grid simply does not have one.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <WaterfallChart data={bridge}>
 *   <WaterfallChart.Grid />
 *   <WaterfallChart.Connectors />
 *   <WaterfallChart.Bars />
 *   <WaterfallChart.XAxis />
 *   <WaterfallChart.Tooltip />
 * </WaterfallChart>
 * ```
 *
 * ## What the shape is asserting
 *
 * **Every bar but a total floats.** A step's bar starts where the previous one
 * ended and reaches as far as its own value carries it, so the gap under it is
 * the running total it is acting on. That floating is the entire point: a bar
 * chart of the same numbers would compare the changes against each other, and
 * this compares each of them against the balance it moved.
 *
 * **A total is anchored to zero.** It is a reading rather than a change, so it
 * is measured from the baseline like an ordinary bar and drawn in a neutral
 * colour. Marking the opening and closing steps `total` is what gives the run
 * two ends to be a bridge between.
 *
 * **Three colours, and no more.** Up, down, and total. A fourth would have to
 * mean something the reader has to be told, and the one thing this chart has
 * going for it is that the direction of a bar is legible before its label is.
 *
 * **The connectors are the sequence.** Without them the bars are a row of
 * floating rectangles at unexplained heights; the line from one bar's end to
 * the next bar's start is what says the second continues the first.
