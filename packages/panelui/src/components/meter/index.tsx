/**
 * A measurement on a fixed scale: disk used, battery left, a score, a password's

 * render and nothing per frame.
 *
 * A meter is not a progress bar. Progress is a task moving towards an end that
 * finishing is the point of; a meter is a reading that happens to sit where it
 * sits, and may go back down. Reach for
 * [Progress](/docs/components/progress) when something is completing.
 *
 * `thresholds` paint the bar by where the reading falls, and `segments` draws
 * the scale as discrete blocks for readings that are counted rather than
 * measured.
 *
 * The value is read against `minValue` / `maxValue`, which default to 0 and
 * 100 — so a percentage needs neither. Set them and the meter speaks in
 * whatever is being measured: bytes, degrees, points. Nothing has to be
 * converted to a percent on the way in, and the screen reader is told the real
 * scale rather than a derived one.
 *
 * React Native has no meter role, so this announces as a progress bar with its
 * value, range and unit attached. That is the closest the platform offers, and
 * it is why `label` matters: the role will not distinguish a reading from a
 * task, and the name is what does.
