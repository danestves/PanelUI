/**
 * Marquee — content that travels across its container and never runs out.
 *
 * For a strip of logos, a ticker of prices, a row of testimonials: anything
 * whose job is to keep moving past a boundary rather than to be scrolled.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <Marquee spacing={24} speed={40}>
 *   <View className="flex-row gap-6">
 *     {sponsors.map((s) => <Logo key={s.id} src={s.logo} />)}
 *   </View>
 * </Marquee>
 * ```
 *
 * ## How it loops
 *
 * The content is measured once, then laid out end to end enough times to cover
 * the container. One track holds every copy and it is that track, not the
 * copies, that moves. The track has a fixed copy budget: exceptionally short
 * content gets extra whitespace instead of multiplying its React subtree
 * hundreds of times. It travels exactly one layout period and starts over, so
 * the state it ends on is the state it began on and the seam never shows.
 *
 * The travel is a linear timing driven on the UI thread, so it costs nothing
 * per frame in JavaScript and keeps running while the thread is busy.
 *
 * ## Measurement needs room
 *
 * The copy that gets measured sits in a hidden scroller, because that is what
 * lets the content report the width it *wants* rather than the width the
 * container would give it. Content with no intrinsic size of its own — a child
 * stretched to `flex-1`, an image with no dimensions — measures as nothing and
 * the marquee will not start.
 *
 * ## Reading direction and reduced motion
 *
 * A horizontal marquee travels toward the end of the line, so it reverses in a
 * right-to-left subtree. `reverse` flips it again from wherever it landed.
 *
 * With the operating system set to reduce motion the content is rendered once
 * and held still. A ticker that never stops is the exact thing that setting is
 * there to turn off, so this is not a shorter animation — it is none.
 *
 * Screen readers get one copy. The rest are duplicates of content already
 * announced, and hearing a sponsor list four times over is not thoroughness.
