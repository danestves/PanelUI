/**
 * useScrollSections — tracks which section of a scroll view you are reading.
 *
 * The active section is the last one whose top has passed a reading line a
 * little way down the viewport, so the heading you have just scrolled past
 * still counts as the one you are in.
 *
 * That rule alone has a hole at the end, and it is the hole every hand-rolled
 * scrollspy has: the final section's top may never reach the reading line,
 * because the content runs out first. Its bar then only lights up if you
 * over-scroll past the bottom. So being at the bottom of the scroll view is
 * treated as being in the last section outright — there is no more scrolling
 * left with which to get there.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const sections = useScrollSections({ ids: SECTIONS.map((s) => s.id) });
 *
 * <ScrollView ref={sections.ref} {...sections.scrollProps}>
 *   {SECTIONS.map((section) => (
 *     <View key={section.id} onLayout={sections.measure(section.id)}>…</View>
 *   ))}
 * </ScrollView>
 *
 * <SectionRail value={sections.active} onValueChange={sections.scrollTo}>…</SectionRail>
 * ```
 *
 * It also publishes the scroll position itself, as `scroll`, so a component
 * that wants a percentage as well as a section name does not need a second
 * scroll listener to get one. The three values are everything a fraction is
 * made of, and they come out of the event this hook is already handling.
