/**
 * useRevealProgress — how far an element has travelled through the viewport.
 *
 * The number every scroll-driven effect is really made of: `0` before the
 * element has arrived, `1` once it has passed, and a smooth scrub between the
 * two. What an effect *does* with it — recolour, fade, zoom, step through
 * frames — is the only part that differs.
 *
 * The window is set the way a scroll-trigger's is: `start` and `end` are
 * positions down the viewport, as fractions of its height. Progress is `0`
 * while the element's **top** is still below `start`, and reaches `1` when its
 * **bottom** passes `end` — so a tall block scrubs across its own height rather
 * than snapping the moment its first line appears.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const { ref, progress } = useRevealProgress({ start: 0.9, end: 0.5 });
 *
 * <Animated.View ref={ref} style={useAnimatedStyle(() => ({
 *   opacity: progress.value,
 * }))} />
 * ```
 *
 * The element is measured on the UI thread whenever the scroll position
 * changes — not every frame, and not once at layout. Once is wrong the moment
 * anything above it resizes; every frame is a measurement pass for a value that
 * only changes when the scroller moves.
